Because He Lives

God sent His Son, they called him Jesus
He came to love, heal and forgive
He bled and died to buy my pardon
An empty grave is there to prove my Saviour lives

Because He lives, I can face tomorrow
Because He lives all fear is gone
Because I know He holds the future
My life is worth the living just because He lives

How sweet to hold a new born baby
And feel the pride and joy He gives
But better still, the calm assurance
That child can face uncertain days because He lives

And then one day I'll cross the river
I'll fight life's final war with pain
And then as death gives way to victory
I'll see the lights of glory and I'll know He lives
