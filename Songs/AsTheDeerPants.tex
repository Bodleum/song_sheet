\begin{song}{As The Deer Pants}
    \verse
    {As the deer pants for the water}
    {So my soul longs after Thee.}
    {You alone are my heart's desire}
    {And I long to worship You}
    \end
    \chorus
    {You alone are my Strength, my Shield}
    {To You alone may my spirit yield}
    {You alone are my heart's desire}
    {And I long to worship Thee}
    \end
    \verse
    {You're my friend and You are my brother,}
    {Even though you are a king.}
    {I love You more than any other,}
    {So much more than anything.}
    \end
    \verse
    {I want You more than gold or silver,}
    {Only You can satisfy.}
    {You alone are the real joy Giver,}
    {And the Apple of my eye.}
    \end
\end{song}
