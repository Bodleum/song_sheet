\begin{song}{Because He Lives}
    \verse
    {God sent His Son, they called him Jesus}
    {He came to love, heal and forgive}
    {He bled and died to buy my pardon}
    {An empty grave is there to prove my Saviour lives}
    \end
    \chorus
    {Because He lives, I can face tomorrow}
    {Because He lives all fear is gone}
    {Because I know He holds the future}
    {My life is worth the living just because He lives}
    \end
    \verse
    {How sweet to hold a new born baby}
    {And feel the pride and joy He gives}
    {But better still, the calm assurance}
    {That child can face uncertain days because He lives}
    \end
    \verse
    {And then one day I'll cross the river}
    {I'll fight life's final war with pain}
    {And then as death gives way to victory}
    {I'll see the lights of glory and I'll know He lives}
    \end
\end{song}
