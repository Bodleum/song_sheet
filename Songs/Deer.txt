As The Deer Pants

As the deer pants for the water
So my soul longs after Thee.
You alone are my heart's desire
And I long to worship You

#c
You alone are my Strength, my Shield
To You alone may my spirit yield
You alone are my heart's desire
And I long to worship Thee

You're my friend and You are my brother,
Even though you are a king.
I love You more than any other,
So much more than anything.

I want You more than gold or silver,
Only You can satisfy.
You alone are the real joy Giver,
And the Apple of my eye.
