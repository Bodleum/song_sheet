\begin{song}{Because He Lives}
    \verse
    {God sent His Son, they called him Jesus}
    {He came to love, heal and forgive}
    {He bled and died to buy my pardon}
    {An empty grave is there to prove my Saviour lives}
    \end
    \chorus
    {Because He lives, I can face tomorrow}
    {Because He lives all fear is gone}
    {Because I know He holds the future}
    {My life is worth the living just because He lives}
    \end
    \verse
    {How sweet to hold a new born baby}
    {And feel the pride and joy He gives}
    {But better still, the calm assurance}
    {That child can face uncertain days because He lives}
    \end
    \verse
    {And then one day I'll cross the river}
    {I'll fight life's final war with pain}
    {And then as death gives way to victory}
    {I'll see the lights of glory and I'll know He lives}
    \end

    {So my soul longs after Thee.}
    {You alone are my heart's desire}
    {And I long to worship You}
    \end
    \chorus
    {You alone are my Strength, my Shield}
    {To You alone may my spirit yield}
    {You alone are my heart's desire}
    {And I long to worship Thee}
    \end
    \verse
    {You're my friend and You are my brother,}
    {Even though you are a king.}
    {I love You more than any other,}
    {So much more than anything.}
    \end
    \verse
    {I want You more than gold or silver,}
    {Only You can satisfy.}
    {You alone are the real joy Giver,}
    {And the Apple of my eye.}

\begin{song}{A Safe Stronghold}
    \verse
    {A safe stronghold our God is still,}
    {A trusty shield and weapon;}
    {He'll help us clear from all the ill}
    {That hath us now o'ertaken.}
    {The ancient prince of hell}
    {Hath risen with purpose fell;}
    {Strong mail of craft and power}
    {He weareth in this hour;}
    {On Earth is not his fellow.}
    \end
    \verse
    {With force of arms we nothing can,}
    {Full soon were we down-ridden;}
    {But for us fights the proper Man,}
    {Whom God Himself hath bidden.}
    {Ask ye, who is this same?}
    {Christ Jesus is His name,}
    {The Lord Sabaoth's Son;}
    {He, and no other one,}
    {Shall conquer in the battle.}
    \end
    \verse
    {And were this world all devils o'er,}
    {And watching to devour us,}
    {We lay it not to heart so sore;}
    {Not they can overpower us.}
    {And let the prince of ill}
    {Look grim as e'er he will,}
    {He harms us not a whit;}
    {For why? His doom is writ;}
    {A word shall quickly slay him.}
    \end
    \verse
    {God's Word, for all their craft and force,}
    {One moment will not linger,}
    {But, spite of hell, shall have its course;}
    {'Tis written by His finger.}
    {And though they take our life,}
    {Goods, honour, children, wife,}
    {Yet is their profit small;}
    {These things shall vanish all:}
    {The City of God remaineth!}
